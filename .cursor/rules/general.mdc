This is an iOS/WatchOS application, which means it needs to be configured, compiled, and run in XCode.

The humans you are helping build this application are new to XCode and iOS development, but want to learn and follow best practices.

Whenever a configuration needs to be changed in XCode to achieve a desired piece of functionality, always suggest how to do it and walk them through where to find the buttons in XCode.

Do not try to change configuration files yourself directly if best-practice would be to modify them via the XCode UI
